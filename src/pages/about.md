# About Source Academy

The Source Academy is a community of learners who use the book [_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Edition_](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/) (SICP JS). The community is developing and maintaining the [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.org/) system, an immersive online experiential environment for learning computational thinking. Here you find resources for [learners](https://about.sourceacademy.org/learner/README.html) and [educators](https://about.sourceacademy.org/educator/README.html) who use SICP JS, for [developers](https://about.sourceacademy.org/developer/README.html) of the system, and for educational [researchers](https://about.sourceacademy.org/research/README.html). <!-- use full URLs for these three references here -->

To get an idea of the system and community, watch the videos of our

Our mission is to _expose the beauty and fun in computational thinking, and make them universally accessible_.
