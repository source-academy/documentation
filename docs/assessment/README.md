## Guide for Assessment Configuration

### Bonus XP calculation

The follwing diagram explains the two configurable numbers(`max bonus xp` and `early hours before xp decay`) in our system for calculating the bonus xp for assessments.

## Guide for authoring and uploading assessments

Pieces of work that are to be submitted by students and the can be graded are called _assessments_ in the Source Academy.

Instructors can specify assessments in an XML format that is documented in this page. They upload assessment files using the "Ground Control" feature of the Source Academy frontend.

Your Source Academy deployment comes with an authoring tool for assessments. Visit
https://your-source-academy-url/mission-control
to access the tool. This page describes the XML format, in case you want to or need to manually edit the assessment XML files.

## General XML file format

Each node may have `attributes`. Each node has either `children` nodes or a `value`. There are no empty elements.

If a property is not documented for an element, then that element does not specify that property. For example, a [TASK](#task) has `attributes` and `children` nodes, and no `value`; and a [READING](#reading) has a `value` and neither `attributes` nor `children`.

Each element is marked as `required` or `optional`. A `required` element is compulsory only if its parent element exists. **All attributes are required (i.e. compulsory) unless explicitly stated "optional"**.

You may assume that each element must be unique (i.e. only one exists per parent), unless specified as "can have many".

## TASK

Represents an assessment. **Required**.

### Attributes

| attribute  | details                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| coverimage | The thumbnail to show for this assessment. Must be a URL, i.e. not a file path. e.g. "https://http.cat/200". Optional.   |
| number     | The string identifier the relative position of this assessment. Must be unique among assessments.                        |
| title      | The title of this assessment.                                                                                            |
| story      | The story XML to load. Must correspond to the filename of a story XML file, e.g. "mission-2", "sidequest-2.1". Optional. |
| access     | Access control for the assessment. Can eitherbe set to "public" or "private". Defaults to "public".                      |

With AY2018/19, there is a change in the way that assessments are named and ordered. E.g. from "mission-2", "mission-19", "sidequest-10.3" to "M2A", "Q10A". This change is reflected in the number attribute.

The story XML to load in the game used to refer to this number attribute However, since the story XML filenames have not been updated to reflect this change in number, we need a new attribute story to point to the right story XML files.

This is not necessarily a bad change, since a module staff may now explicitly refer to a story XML file to be loaded for the assessment, rather than have it be implicitly inferred from the number attribute. Additionally, module staff writing story XML files will now have greater flexibility in how to name their files.

### Children

[READING](#reading), [WEBSUMMARY](#websummary), [TEXT](#text), - [LLM_GRADING_PROMPT](#llm_grading_prompt), [PROBLEMS](#problems), [DEPLOYMENT](#deployment), [GRADERDEPLOYMENT](#graderdeployment), [PASSWORD](#password)

Example

```xml
<TASK
  access="public"
  coverimage="http://via.placeholder.com/350x150"
  number="M2A"
  title="Beyond the Second Dimension"
  story="mission-2"
>
  ...
</TASK>
```

## PASSWORD

Only appiles to "private" assessments. Please choose a strong a complex password. If no password is given, an empty string (`""`) will be used.

### Value

A String that represents the assessment password.

### Example

```xml
<PASSWORD>MySuperSecretPassword1!23%$#@%</PASSWORD>
```

## READING

Represents a recommended reading from the textbook. Optional.

### Value

Text to be shown to the student, representing a recommended reading from the textbook.

### Example

```xml
<READING>Textbook Sections 1.1.1 to 1.1.4</READING>
```

## WEBSUMMARY

Represents a summary of the assessment to be shown in the list of assessments. Relevant only for the cadet website. Optional.

WEBSUMMARY is a new element defined for the cadet website. It is currently optional in order to minimise the amount of work required to migrate to this new API specification, but it is highly recommended that every [TASK](#task) have a WEBSUMMARY.

### Value

Text to be shown to the student, representing a summary of the assessment.

### Example

```xml
<WEBSUMMARY>A small scare broke out in the server room of the spaceship...</WEBSUMMARY>
```

## TEXT

Represents text to be shown to the student. Uses github-flavoured markdown. Can have many.

Required: at least one TEXT element as a direct child of each TASK, PROBLEM, and CHOICE.

### Value

Text to be shown to the student. The TEXT element may render differently based on its position and order in the XML tree.

- As a child of [TASK](#task), the first TEXT element is taken to be the assessment briefing. This provides a general overview of the assessment.
- As a child of [PROBLEM][def], the first TEXT element is taken to be the task description for "programming" questions, otherwise the MCQ question for "mcq" questions.
- As a child of [CHOICE](#choice), the first TEXT element is taken to be the content of said choice in the PROBLEM.
  Other TASK elements may be rendered in the assessment pdf, but are otherwise ignored by cadet.

Note that XML preserves whitespaces, so the indentations of the string in this value property will be exactly what is passed to the markdown parser; i.e. the text you write here should start with an absolute indentation level of 0. In addition, you must escape predefined XML entities quot ("), amp (&), apos ('), lt (<), and gt (>).

Note that the current backend implementation supports only absolute URLs for embedded images, i.e. not file paths. You can consider using an online image hosting service, e.g. Imgur.

### Example

````xml
<TEXT>
Write a function `steps` that takes four runes as arguments and arranges
them in a *2 x 2* square, starting with the top-right corner, going
clockwise, just like `mosaic` in Mission 1.

```
steps(rcross_bb, sail_bb, corner_bb, nova_bb);
```

</TEXT>
````
## LLM_GRADING_PROMPT

Represents the instructions provided to GPT for grading. It guides GPT on how to evaluate and assess the student's solution accurately. Optional for both task and problem. 

### Value

- As a child of [TASK](#task) the LLM_GRADING_PROMPT element is used to provide instructions to GPT on how to grade the assessment.
- As a child of [PROBLEM][def] the LLM_GRADING_PROMPT element is used to provide instructions to GPT on how to grade the question. 

## PROBLEMS

Represents a set of PROBLEM elements. Required.

| showsolution | Default false; If value is string "true", the solution string is shipped to web client. <br><sub> In a PROBLEM of type "mcq', the solution is used on the frontend to determine if the student's answer is correct (and to provide immediate visual feedback to the student by highlighting the selection green or red). This can be used together with the attribute `blocking` to ensure students answer MCQ questions correctly before proceeding to the next question. In the event `showsolution` is "false" and `blocking` is "true", the frontend is unable to verify the student's MCQ answer, and will allow him/ her to proceed after making any selection.</sub> <br><sub> In a PROBLEM of type "programming", the solution string, if sent, is currently NOT displayed to the student on the frontend. However, this might be subject to changes in the future, and the documentation will be updated accordingly here. Do note that more astute students might open the browser's network tab to view the solution string directly if it is sent. </sub> |

```

## DEPLOYMENT

Represents interpreter settings for the source interpreter of cadet.

**Required** for each [TASK](#task), optional for each [PROBLEM][def].

For a given PROBLEM, the following checks are performed to determine what interpreter settings should be used for the PROBLEM:

If the PROBLEM has a child DEPLOYMENT, use that
Otherwise, use the DEPLOYMENT which is a child of the TASK
The missionType attribute was previously used by source-academy2, but is unused by cadet.

### Attributes

| attributes  | details                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| interpreter | The Source chapter to use.                                                                                                    |
| variant     | The Source variant to use; one of `wasm`, `lazy`, `non-det`, `concurrent`, `gpu`, `default`. Optional, defaults to `default`. |
| exectime    | Execution time limit, in milliseconds. Optional, defaults to 1000.                                                            |

### Children

[IMPORT](#import), [EXTERNAL](#external), [GLOBAL](#global)

### Example

```xml
<DEPLOYMENT interpreter="2" variant="default" exectime="1000">
  <IMPORT module="cs1101s_1920/two_dim_runes">
      <SYMBOL>beside</SYMBOL>
      <SYMBOL>make_cross</SYMBOL>
  </IMPORT>
  <EXTERNAL name="CURVES">
      <SYMBOL>draw_points_on</SYMBOL>
      <SYMBOL>draw_connected</SYMBOL>
  </EXTERNAL>
  <GLOBAL>
      <IDENTIFIER>student_names</IDENTIFIER>
      <VALUE>list("Alpha Centauri", "007", "Gilgamesh");</VALUE>
  </GLOBAL>
</DEPLOYMENT>
```

## GRADERDEPLOYMENT

Represents interpreter settings which override that of DEPLOYMENT, for the grader. Optional for both TASK and PROBLEM.

For a given PROBLEM, the following checks are performed to determine what interpreter settings should be used for the grader:

If the PROBLEM has a child GRADERDEPLOYMENT, use that
Otherwise, if the PROBLEM has a child DEPLOYMENT, use that
Otherwise, if the TASK has a child GRADERDEPLOYMENT, use that
Otherwise, use the DEPLOYMENT which is a child of the TASK
This element is useful for assessments that utilise imported modules which use browser based APIs such as WebGL or HTML5 Audio. Since the grader runs on a node environment, these APIs are not available to the grader. Hence, it may be useful to 'overwrite' these functions with mock node-friendly alternative functions.

Examples include `show` from the runes module, `draw_connected` from the curves module, or `play` from the sound module.

### Attributes

| attributes  | details                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| interpreter | The source chapter to use. |

### Children

[IMPORT](#import), [EXTERNAL](#external), [GLOBAL](#global)

### Example

```xml
<GRADERDEPLOYMENT interpreter="2">

</IMPORT>
```

## EXTERNAL

Represents an "external" library to be exposed to the student. Optional.

### Attributes

| attributes | details                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Children

[SYMBOL](#symbol)

### Example

```xml

  <SYMBOL>make_cross</SYMBOL>
</EXTERNAL>
```

## SYMBOL

Represents an identifier from the [IMPORT](#import)ed module, or [EXTERNAL](#external) library or [GLOBAL](#global) variables to be exposed through the Source implementation. Put simply, this declares a variable in the source context that points to an identically named variable in the window namespace. Optional. Can have many.

The identifier exposed by the source interpreter will take the same name as the identifier it points to in the IMPORTed module. For example, the function `show` in Source will execute the function `show` in the specified IMPORTed module.

### Value

Text representing a valid JavaScript identifier name for the symbol.

### Example

```xml
<SYMBOL>beside</SYMBOL>
<SYMBOL>make_cross</SYMBOL>
```

## GLOBAL

Represents a variable to be dumped into the window namespace. Optional. Can have many.

This is useful to define functions or constants for the student's use, which are not provided by imported modules. For example, you may wish to expose a variable containing a list of names for the student to sort through in sorting missions.

You may also use this to override some property of the window, perhaps originating from an IMPORTed module.

### Children

[IDENTIFIER](#identifier), [VALUE](#value)

### Example

```xml
<GLOBAL>
  <IDENTIFIER>student_names</IDENTIFIER>
  <VALUE>list("Alpha Centauri", "007", "Gilgamesh");</VALUE>
</GLOBAL>
```

## IDENTIFIER

Represents the identifier name of a GLOBAL variable. Required.

### Value

Text representing a valid javascript identifier name for the GLOBAL variable.

### Example

```xml
<IDENTIFIER>student_names</IDENTIFIER>
```

## VALUE

Represents the javascript value of a GLOBAL variable. Required.

### Value

Text representing a valid JavaScript program to be eval'd. The return value of this evaluation is then taking to be the value of the GLOBAL variable.

  <WEBSUMMARY>
Welcome to your 99th mission!
  </WEBSUMMARY>
  <TEXT>
Welcome to this assessment! This is the *briefing*.

This mission consists of **four tasks**.

1. A simple PROBLEM that uses the default DEPLOYMENT and GRADERDEPLOYMENT
   for its GRADER programs (source 1).
2. A sorting PROBLEM that uses it's own DEPLOYMENT AND GRADERDEPLOYMENT.
   Here, GLOBALs and IMPORT are used to pre-define lists for the students
   as well as the grader to test the functions with.
3. An MCQ question.
4. A question which makes use of an imported module, `cs1101s_1920/two_dim_runes`.
   The functions from the module are exposed to the Source
   interpreter's global namespace according to what is specified in the
   SYMBOL elements.

## Submission

Make sure that everything for your programs to work is on the left hand side
and **not** in the REPL on the right! This is because only that program is
used to assess your solution.

This TEXT will not be shown in cadet, but may be useful in the generated pdf.
